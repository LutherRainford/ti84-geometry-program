# ti84-geometry-program
This is a program for the TI-84 Plus CE graphing calculator that a friend and I also wrote at some point in 6th grade. Nothing has really been changed about it since then. It basically just find the area, surface area, and volume of different types of shapes. 

Written in TI-BASIC
